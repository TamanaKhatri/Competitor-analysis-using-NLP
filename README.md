# Competitor-analysis-using-NLP
In the rapidly growing e-commerce sector in India, the beauty and cosmetics segment has seen an unprecedented surge. Nykaa, being a dedicated platform for beauty and fashion, has become a market leader in this niche. However, platforms like Myntra, initially rooted in apparel, are diversifying and making significant strides in the beauty segment. To ensure sustained leadership, a granular understanding of the competitor's strategies, offerings, and customer perception is crucial. This model will help Nykaa to retain its position as the market leader. 

This project mainly focuses on extracting the user reviews from the competitor's web application and converting those into meaningful insights using Natural Language Processing techniques
